ORAKLE AMM Team Project: Quantification & Mitigation of LVR.

We measured historical LVR and arbitrageurs' profit which were predicted in two seminal papers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06046.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14604.pdf) written by J. Milionis et al. Clearly, the real world data has slight difference from theoretical predictions. Analysis on the result will be discussed in upcoming article.

Other than above two, the code and methodology of this repo are heavily influenced by following references:
