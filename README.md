ORAKLE AMM Team Project: Quantification & Mitigation of LVR.

We measured historical LVR and other metrics which were defined and predicted in two seminal papers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06046.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14604.pdf) written by J. Milionis et al. Clearly, the real world data has slight difference from theoretical predictions. We analyze the reasons.

Moreover, we listed and compared upcoming new DEX designs to mitigate the LVR.
