ORAKLE AMM Team Project: Quantification & Mitigation of LVR.

We measured historical LVR and arbitrageurs' profit which were predicted in two seminal papers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06046.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14604.pdf) written by J. Milionis et al. Clearly, the real world data has slight difference from theoretical predictions. Analysis on the result will be discussed in upcoming article.
